ABLexer
=======

A tool for generating Java class lexical scanners (tokenizers), which recognize lexical patterns in text.

Short description (Version: Beta)

Accepts a java 1.5 source file with a ABLexer script closure placed anywhere within the top level class and outputs the java source file with a lexical analyzer code added. The front end is Java 1.5 and ABLexer script parser. The back end is a deterministic finite automata (DFA) java code generator.

P.S.
Extended explanation and examples are coming...
